Using the Google Analytics API to Measure Meme Ranking:

The Google Analytics API can be a powerful tool to measure and analyze the popularity and engagement of memes across different platforms and websites. Here's a high-level overview of how you could utilize the Google
Analytics API to measure the ranking of memes in your military-inspired meme ranking system:

1. **Set Up Google Analytics Account and API Access**:
   - Create a Google Analytics account if you don't have one.
   - Set up a new Google API project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the Google Analytics API for that project.
   - Obtain the necessary credentials (API key, client ID, client secret) to authenticate and access the API.

2. **Define Metrics and Dimensions**:
   - Decide on the specific metrics and dimensions you want to track for your memes. For example, you might track metrics like page views, unique pageviews, time on page, and dimensions like the meme's URL or category.

3. **Tag Memes with Tracking Codes**:
   - Tag your memes with appropriate tracking codes using Google Analytics tracking tags. This will allow you to collect data on meme engagement.

4. **Retrieve Data Using the API**:
   - Use the Google Analytics API to retrieve data for your tagged memes. You can use the "ga:pageviews," "ga:uniquePageviews," and other relevant metrics to measure meme popularity and engagement.

5. **Calculate Meme Rankings**:
   - Based on the retrieved data, you can calculate a ranking score for each meme. This score could be a combination of metrics like page views, unique pageviews, time spent on page, and any other
engagement-related data you're tracking.

6. **Display and Update Rankings**:
   - Develop a dashboard or interface where you display the meme rankings. You can sort memes based on their calculated ranking scores to show which memes are currently leading in popularity.

7. **Periodic Updates**:
   - Regularly fetch updated data using the API to keep your meme rankings current. This could be done daily, weekly, or as often as needed.

8. **Visualization and Insights**:
   - Create visualizations and insights based on the collected data. You could display trends over time, compare meme categories, or highlight memes that are rapidly gaining popularity.

9. **Adjust Ranking Algorithm**:
   - Over time, you may refine your ranking algorithm based on user feedback and evolving meme trends.

Remember that setting up and working with the Google Analytics API can involve technical implementation and coding. It's also important to respect privacy and data protection regulations when 
collecting and using user data. This overview provides a general 
framework for integrating the Google Analytics API into your meme ranking system, but the specific 
implementation details may vary based on your requirements and technical expertise.

from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials

# Set your Google Analytics API credentials
CLIENT_ID = 'your_client_id'
CLIENT_SECRET = 'your_client_secret'
REFRESH_TOKEN = 'your_refresh_token'

# Set up API client

            }
        ]
    }

    meme_url = meme['dimensions'][0]
    pageviews = int(meme['metrics'][0]['values'][0])
    unique_pageviews = int(meme['metrics'][0]['values'][1])

    # Calculate a simple ranking score (you can adjust this algorithm)
    ranking_score = pageviews + 2 * unique_pageviews

    meme_rankings.append({'url': meme_url, 'score': ranking_score})

# Sort memes by ranking score
sorted_rankings = sorted(meme_rankings, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)

# Display the meme rankings
for idx, meme in enumerate(sorted_rankings, start=1):
    print(f"{idx}. Meme URL: {meme['url']}, Score: {meme['score']}")
